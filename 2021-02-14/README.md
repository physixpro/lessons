Functions perform a series of steps to return a result

arguments/params/inputs 

output - returns

# defining a function - 
1. It is determining what inputs (think of them as placeholders) the function needs to run. 

2. You have to define what this function does. 

3. What is this function going to return

# executing a function - 
1. Run the function by using its name

2. determine what inputs this function needs to run & pass them in. (actual values)

3. Receive the output


```js

function add(a,b){
    return a + b;
}

// assign a variable (sum) to the output 
const sum = add(1,2) 


```
